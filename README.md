## 💡 About the App

Ribbons is not a dating app; it is a tool for **affinity and connection**. It focuses on strengthening real bonds by looking beyond surface-level interests and diving into the core of what users genuinely consume and love on a daily basis.

The application functions as a "web of affinities," where every interest becomes a thread, and Ribbons expertly weaves these threads together.

## 🧠 How Matching Works

The core intelligence of Ribbons goes beyond simple categorization. It analyzes affinity based on several key factors:

* **Cultural Consumption Patterns:** Mapping the general landscape of a user's digital habits.
* **Recurrence:** Identifying content the user returns to, indicating deep interest.
* **Strong Overlaps:** Identifying deep, surprising coincidences that are guaranteed conversation starters.

The goal is to **discover profound and unexpected coincidences** that spark conversation and lead to genuine friendship, avoiding random or surface-level matches.
